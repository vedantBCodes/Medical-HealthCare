    <h3>✫ Exercise for Teenagers: A Complete Guide
    </h3>
    <P>
        ♦ Exercising improves both mental and physical health, and yet it is incredibly easy to stay sedentary in today’s world. Conveniences such as remote work and school, food delivery services, and screen-time pastimes can dramatically reduce the time we spend on our feet, leading to far less actual movement or exertion.
<br><br>
        ♦  For that reason, getting up and moving is a critical part of staying healthy, now more than ever, no matter how old you are. Developing healthy habits in the impressionable teen years leads to greater health and satisfaction in the short term while setting up habits that can last well into adulthood.

<h3>✫ How much exercise do teenagers need?</h3>
<P>
     ♦ According to the CDC, children aged 6 through 17 need about an hour of moderate to high intensity exercise daily (1Trusted Source). Kids who exercise tend to have stronger bones and muscles, as well as healthier body fat compositions.
<br><br>
     ♦ Youth who exercise also tend to experience a lower incidence of depression (2). Exercise can take the form of sports play, aerobic exercise such as walking or roller skating, or strength training.
     <br><br>
     ♦ Still, only 25% of American teens reach this recommendation (3Trusted Source). If this seems like a tall order, the minimum recommendation is 30 minutes of exercise, three times per week.
     <br><br>
     ♦ That’s quite a difference from the recommended amount, and it’s easy to imagine that the closer you are to the hour per day recommendation, the better your results will be. It’s possible, however to take this “more is better” attitude too far.
</P>
<h6>✫ This means training smart, which includes knowing the ideal training variables for teens, how to train for best results, and the best workout plan for teens (boys and girls alike). Fortunately, you've come to the right place, because we're about to get into all of that.</h6>

<b>✫ HOW TO DETERMINE IF THIS PLAN IS RIGHT FOR YOU</b>
<P>
    ♦ If you have hit puberty, keep scrolling to the workout plan, because it is for you! If you have yet to hit puberty, switch to this calisthenics workout plan as bodyweight moves are better for you.
    <br><br>
    ♦ Before puberty, youth and teens can lift weights, but the goal should be on learning movements and increasing fitness rather than raising heavy weights and building muscles. Youth can’t put on mass before puberty, as they haven't yet had their hefty dose of muscle-building hormones, like testosterone and other growth hormones, dumped into their bloodstream. 
    <br><br>
    ♦ A pre-puberty child should instead work out to improve their neuromuscular system, meaning they're training their muscles to work better. This can be done using bodyweight movements and unilateral training, in addition to improving their cardiovascular system using things like HIIT or sled work.
    <br><br>
    ♦ After puberty, once your body gets a dose of testosterone, hit the weights to put on mass and strength. There’s a theory that this time, and the few years following, are the best times to put on mass. Assuming a teen is at a healthy weight, many coaches will recommend a bulking diet along with a plan that looks more like a bodybuilder.

<h3>✫ About Sets and Reps</h3>
<P>
    Most fitness instructors recommend repeating a particular strength training exercise several times in a row. These are known as repetitions, or “reps,” and they’re done in “sets.” Each set consists of a specific number of reps, usually between 8 and 15. Fitness instructors often recommend that people rest after one set and then perform another set (or more) of the same number of reps. For the exercises shown above, start with 10 reps, adding sets of 10 as you get comfortable. Rest for 30 seconds between sets.
