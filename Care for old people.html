    <h3>✫ Home Care vs. Home Health Care</h3>
    <P>
        ♦ These terms, “home care” and “home health care”, are sometimes used interchangeably, but there is an important distinction. While both types of care are provided in the individual’s home, home care generally means custodial or unskilled care is being provided. For example, assistance is provided with bathing and dressing the individual, doing the laundry, cooking, and accompanying the care recipient to doctors’ appointments or on other errands. One may also hear this type of care referred to as personal care or attendant care, although those terms are not exclusively for care provided in the home.
<br><br>
        ♦ Home health care refers to a higher level of care, which requires medical training. This includes procedures such as checking the individual’s vitals and respiration, and assisting with braces, artificial limbs, and other medical equipment, such as ventilators. To be clear, it is not unusual for home health care providers to also provide custodial care during their home visits.

<h3>✫ Issue Brief: Care Coordination & Older Adults</h3>
   <P>♦ The Eldercare Workforce Alliance (EWA) released an <b><a href="issuebriefoldpeoplecare.html">Issue Brief</a> </b> , "Care Coordination," in partnership with the National Coalition On Care Coordination (N3C) and the Center for Health and Social Care Integration (CHaSCi).

    ♦ There has been significant emphasis in the last several years on care coordination’s role in supporting older adults and in reaching the key aims of health care reform, namely improved patient outcomes, enhanced care experience, reduced costs, reduced provider burnout, and equity in outcomes.
    
    ♦ The issue brief provides updates to the 2013 care coordination issue brief developed by EWA and N3C. The brief includes a synthesis of diverse strategies in use and a vision for how services could be improved.

    <h3>✫ Caregiving for Older Adults</h3>
    <P>♦ You might take care of a loved one in your home or theirs. Whether you do it full time or just help out once in a while, consider these things when caring for an older adult.</P>
    <P><b>✫ Plan Ahead</b><br><br>
        ♦ Talk to your loved one about what kind of help they think they need and how they’d like to get it. It can be hard sometimes to plan ahead, because you don’t know how needs will change. But come up with a road map for care.<br><br>
        ♦ Get your loved one’s doctor involved. Make sure you know all their health problems and what level of care they might require.<br><br>
        ♦ Ask these questions: Is your loved one able to stay at home alone with help from time to time? Or would it be better for them to move in with you or into a facility? Make a care plan to chart what kind of help they need.<br><br>

    <h3>✫ Types of Care</h3>
    <p>
        <b>✫ You might have to provide different kinds of support depending on your loved one’s needs:</b><br><br>
        <b>♦ Personal care:</b> They might need help with bathing, dressing, grooming, and other personal care. This could include helping them get to the bathroom and cleaning themselves after. For aging parents, it’s a role reversal because they’re used to taking care of their kids. If either of you is uncomfortable with bathing or toilet care, you may want to hire a home health aide.<br><br>

<b>♦ Household help:</b> They might need help with cleaning, laundry, and yard work. Food also can be a key part of caregiving. Your loved one could need help grocery shopping and preparing healthy meals. You can cook for them or have some meals delivered. Taking your loved one out to eat or bringing them to your home gives them a chance to be social and visit with other people.<br><br>

<b>♦ Emotional support:</b> Your loved one might need you to spend time with them, just talking and offering emotional support. They could come to rely on you for regular visits to keep them company, so they don’t get lonely. Sometimes older people can easily forget things or get grumpy. Be calm and patient with them when you’re together.<br><br>

<b>♦ Health care:</b> You might need to help with their medical needs, like making sure they take medicines or going with them to doctor’s appointments. To make it easier, you can prepare pillboxes that have each day’s pills ready for a whole week. It helps to go to doctor visits to ask questions and take notes.<br><br>

<h3>✫ Understand Health Issues</h3>

<P>♦ There’s a chance your loved one will have some health concerns. Older people often have issues like heart disease, Alzheimer’s, and depression.<br><br>

    ♦  It’s important that you learn about any health problems, so you know what to look out for. You’ll be able to spot symptoms if things get worse. You’ll also be better prepared at doctor visits to give updates on their health<br><br>

    ♦ Elders often bring a sense of comfort and joy to the home. These people are the reason why holidays feel special, with the love they provide us and the blessings that they give us. But they are also very feeble due to their age and require lots of love, attention, and constant care all the time.<br><br>

    ♦ Elderly people cannot entirely depend on their younger generation, especially since they have a life of their own. However, there are numerous other ways to take care of them. This article explains all the things a person can do to ensure that their elderly, loved one feels cherished and taken care of properly.<br><br>
   
    ♦ As time passes, the elderly tend to become weak due to their old age, which is why it becomes essential to provide them with meals that keep them healthy and active. If the elderly in the house need special care when it comes to their meals according to their requirements, the best thing to do is to hire a home care service in the bay area as they know what meals should be given to elders according to their current health status.<br><br>

      <h3>✫ Make the Home Safe</h3>
      <P>
        <b>✫ Whether your loved one is staying in their home or yours, make safety a priority. Take steps to reduce their risk of falling, and other basic safety measures like these:</b><br><br>
        ♦ Remove throw rugs.<br><br>
        ♦ Place non-skid strips on hardwood and tile floors.<br><br>
        ♦ Add safety rails in showers and tubs and near the toilet.<br><br>
        ♦ Reduce water temperature to below 120 F (48.9 C).<br><br>
        ♦ Move furniture and clear clutter to create clear, wide paths.<br><br>
        ♦ Place nightlights throughout the home.<br><br>
        ♦ Cover stairs with non-skid strips or carpet, and install nightlights at the top and bottom.
