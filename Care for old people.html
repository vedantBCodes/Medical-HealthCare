<h1>✫ Issue Brief: Care Coordination & Older Adults</h1>
   <P>♦ The Eldercare Workforce Alliance (EWA) released an <b><a href="issuebriefoldpeoplecare.html">Issue Brief</a> </b> , "Care Coordination," in partnership with the National Coalition On Care Coordination (N3C) and the Center for Health and Social Care Integration (CHaSCi).

    ♦ There has been significant emphasis in the last several years on care coordination’s role in supporting older adults and in reaching the key aims of health care reform, namely improved patient outcomes, enhanced care experience, reduced costs, reduced provider burnout, and equity in outcomes.
    
    ♦ The issue brief provides updates to the 2013 care coordination issue brief developed by EWA and N3C. The brief includes a synthesis of diverse strategies in use and a vision for how services could be improved.

    <h1>✫ Caregiving for Older Adults</h1>
    <P>♦ You might take care of a loved one in your home or theirs. Whether you do it full time or just help out once in a while, consider these things when caring for an older adult.</P>
    <P><b>✫ Plan Ahead</b><br><br>
        ♦ Talk to your loved one about what kind of help they think they need and how they’d like to get it. It can be hard sometimes to plan ahead, because you don’t know how needs will change. But come up with a road map for care.<br><br>
        ♦ Get your loved one’s doctor involved. Make sure you know all their health problems and what level of care they might require.<br><br>
        ♦ Ask these questions: Is your loved one able to stay at home alone with help from time to time? Or would it be better for them to move in with you or into a facility? Make a care plan to chart what kind of help they need.<br><br>
  
    </P>
    <h1>✫ Types of Care</h1>
    <p>
        <b>✫ You might have to provide different kinds of support depending on your loved one’s needs:</b><br><br>
        <b>♦ Personal care:</b> They might need help with bathing, dressing, grooming, and other personal care. This could include helping them get to the bathroom and cleaning themselves after. For aging parents, it’s a role reversal because they’re used to taking care of their kids. If either of you is uncomfortable with bathing or toilet care, you may want to hire a home health aide.<br><br>

<b>♦ Household help:</b> They might need help with cleaning, laundry, and yard work. Food also can be a key part of caregiving. Your loved one could need help grocery shopping and preparing healthy meals. You can cook for them or have some meals delivered. Taking your loved one out to eat or bringing them to your home gives them a chance to be social and visit with other people.<br><br>

<b>♦ Emotional support:</b> Your loved one might need you to spend time with them, just talking and offering emotional support. They could come to rely on you for regular visits to keep them company, so they don’t get lonely. Sometimes older people can easily forget things or get grumpy. Be calm and patient with them when you’re together.<br><br>

<b>♦ Health care:</b> You might need to help with their medical needs, like making sure they take medicines or going with them to doctor’s appointments. To make it easier, you can prepare pillboxes that have each day’s pills ready for a whole week. It helps to go to doctor visits to ask questions and take notes.<br><br>
</p>

<h1>✫ Understand Health Issues</h1>

<P>♦ There’s a chance your loved one will have some health concerns. Older people often have issues like heart disease, Alzheimer’s, and depression.<br><br>

    ♦  It’s important that you learn about any health problems, so you know what to look out for. You’ll be able to spot symptoms if things get worse. You’ll also be better prepared at doctor visits to give updates on their health
</P>

      <h1>✫ Make the Home Safe</h1>
      <P>
        <b>✫ Whether your loved one is staying in their home or yours, make safety a priority. Take steps to reduce their risk of falling, and other basic safety measures like these:</b><br><br>
        ♦ Remove throw rugs.<br><br>
        ♦ Place non-skid strips on hardwood and tile floors.<br><br>
        ♦ Add safety rails in showers and tubs and near the toilet.<br><br>
        ♦ Reduce water temperature to below 120 F (48.9 C).<br><br>
        ♦ Move furniture and clear clutter to create clear, wide paths.<br><br>
        ♦ Place nightlights throughout the home.<br><br>
