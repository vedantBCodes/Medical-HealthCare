    <h3>✫ Healthy eating and diet</h3>
    <P>
        <b>Summary</b><br><br>
        ♦ Eating a wide variety of healthy foods helps to keep you in good health and protects you against chronic disease. <br><br>
        ♦ Eating a well-balanced diet means eating a variety of foods from each of the 5 food groups daily, in the recommended amounts. <br><br>
        ♦ It is also important to choose a variety of foods from within each food group. <br><br>
        ♦ Takeaway foods, cakes, biscuits and soft drinks are examples of foods usually high in saturated fat, added salt or added sugars. They should be considered as extras to your usual diet and only eaten occasionally and in small amounts.<br><br>
        ♦ The recommended number of serves for each food group is different for children, teenagers, women and men.<br>

<h3>✫ Australian Dietary Guidelines</h3>
<P>
    ♦  Do you know what foods are best to put on your plate? Or how much you should eat and how often?
    <br><br>
    ♦ The Australian Dietary Guidelines provide up-to-date advice about the types and recommended number of serves of the different foods that we need to eat for good nutrition and health. These are shown in the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating.
    <br><br>
    ♦ The Guidelines are developed by the National Health and Medical Research Council, working with independent experts in nutrition. They are based on the best available science about the types and amounts of foods and the dietary patterns that are thought to promote health and wellbeing, and reduce your risk of diet-related conditions and chronic disease.

<h3>✫ Eat a variety of foods</h3>
<P>
    ♦  Healthy eating means eating a wide variety of foods from each of the 5 major food groups, in the amounts recommended.
    <br><br>
    ♦ Eating a variety of foods from the 5 major food groups provides a range of nutrients to the body, promotes good health and can help reduce the risk of disease - as well as keeping your diet interesting with different flavours and textures.
    <br><br>
    ♦ Many of the foods that often feature regularly in modern diets do not form part of the 5 food groups. These foods, sometimes referred to as 'junk' foods, 'discretionary choices' or 'occasional foods' can be enjoyed sometimes, but should not feature regularly in a healthy diet. Fats and oils are high in kilojoules (energy) but necessary for a healthy diet in small amounts.
    <br><br>
    ♦ No matter where you're starting, it's easy to make little changes to bring your eating closer in line with the Australian Dietary Guidelines. Just focus on eating foods from the 5 major food groups and reducing your intake of occasional foods.

<h3>✫ Occasional foods</h3>
<p>
    ♦  Some foods do not fit into the 5 food groups because they are not necessary for a healthy diet. These foods are called 'discretionary choices' (sometimes referred to as 'junk foods') and they should only be eaten occasionally.
    <br><br>
    ♦ They tend to be too high in saturated fat, added sugars, added salt or alcohol, and have low levels of important nutrients like fibre.
    <br><br>
    ♦ These foods and drinks can also be too high in kilojoules (energy). Regularly eating more kilojoules than your body needs will lead to weight gain.
    <br><br>
    ♦ Examples of 'discretionary choices' or occasional foods are:
    <br><br>
    ♦ sweet biscuits, cakes, desserts and pastries<br><br>
    ♦ processed meats and fatty, salty sausages, savoury pastries and pies, with a high fat or salt content<br><br>
    ♦ takeaway foods such as hot chips, hamburgers and pizza<br><br>
    ♦ sweetened condensed milk<br><br>
    ♦ alcoholic drinks<br><br>
    ♦ vice cream and other ice confections<br><br>
    ♦ confectionary and chocolate<br><br>
    ♦ commercially fried foods<br><br>
    ♦ potato chips, crisps and other fatty and/or salty snack foods including some savoury biscuits<br><br>
    ♦ cream, butter and spreads which are high in saturated fats<br><br>

<h3>✫ Drink alcohol in moderation</h3>
<P>
    Alcoholic drinks are ‘occasional foods’ according to the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating. Alcohol is high in energy (kilojoules). If you choose to drink alcohol, only drink it in moderation.
    <br><br>
    To reduce the risk of harm from alcohol-related disease or injury, healthy men and women should drink no more than 10 standard drinks a week and no more than 4 standard drinks on any one day.
    <br><br>
    The less you drink, the lower your risk of harm from alcohol.
    <br><br>
    One standard drink is 375 ml mid-strength beer, 100 ml wine or 30 ml spirits. If you drink more than this, consider reducing the amount. You might go about this by increasing the number of days in the week where you don’t drink alcohol, or alternating your alcoholic drinks with water.
    <br><br>
    Children and pregnant or breastfeeding women should not drink alcohol.
</P>
