   <h1>✫ Can you still get genital warts if you've had all the HPV shots?</h1> 
   <P>
    ♦ There is a small chance that someone might still get genital warts after having all their HPV vaccine shots. The vaccine protects against 90% of the HPV strains that cause genital warts. But there are many different strains (types) of HPV and the vaccine can't protect against them all.<br><br>

    ♦ The real purpose of the HPV vaccine is to protect against cervical cancer and other types of cancers. Experts have found that some strains of HPV may cause cancers of the cervix, vagina, vulva, penis, anus, mouth, and throat. The shots help protect people against the strains of HPV that are most likely to cause cancer.<br><br>

    ♦ So, like most things in life, the HPV vaccine doesn't come with a 100% guarantee. But it's still wise to get all the shots: When it comes to cancer, the more protected you are, the better.<br><br>

    ♦ Also, if you do have sex, it's still important to see your doctor regularly and use condoms to protect against STDs (including those strains of HPV that aren't covered by the shot).

   <h1>✫ What Is HPV and Why Is It a Problem?</h1>
   <img src="Images/hvp.webp" width="400px" alt="" srcset="">
<P>
    ♦ Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a virus that can cause cervical cancer as well as genital warts. It can spread through sex and from some types of skin-to skin-contact.<br><br>

<b>✫ An HPV infection also can cause these other problems:</b><br><br>

♦ It can lead to cancer of the cervix , vagina, vulva, penis, anus , mouth, and throat.<br><br>
♦ New research suggests that HPV may be linked to heart disease in women.<br><br>
♦ People can get HPV from sexual contact, including vaginal, oral, and anal sex. Most people infected with HPV don't know they have it because they don't notice any signs or problems. People do not always get genital warts, but the virus is still in their system and could cause damage. This means that people with HPV can pass the infection to others without knowing it.<br><br>

♦Because HPV can cause problems like some kinds of cancer and genital warts, a vaccine is an important step in preventing infection and protecting against the spread of HPV.

<h1>✫ How Does the HPV Vaccine Work?</h1>
<img src="Images/hvp1.jpg" width="400px" alt="" srcset="">
<P>
    ♦ The HPV vaccine is recommended for people 9 to 26 years old:<br><br>

    ♦ For ages 9–14, the vaccine is given in 2 shots over a 6- to 12-month period.<br><br>
    ♦ For ages 15–26, it's given in 3 shots over a 6-month period. People with weak immune systems also get 3 shots, including those 9–14 years old.<br><br>
    ♦ It works best when people get all their shots on time. If you're under age 26 and you've missed a shot, you can still catch up. Just ask your doctor about the best way to do that.<br><br>
    
    ♦ The vaccine does not protect people against strains of HPV that might have infected them before getting the vaccine. The most effective way to prevent HPV infection is to get vaccinated before having sex for the first time. But even if you have had sex, it's still the best way to protect against strains of the virus that you may not have come in contact with.<br><br>
    
    ♦ The vaccine doesn't protect against all types of HPV. Anyone having sex should get routine checkups at a doctor's office or health clinic. It's important to get Pap smears when a doctor recommends it — for most girls, that's usually around age 21 unless there are signs of a problem before that. 
</P>
<h1>✫ How Can I Protect Myself From HPV ?</h1>
<P>
    ♦ The most important way to protect against HPV infection is by getting the HPV vaccine.<br><br>

    ♦ For people who have sex, condoms offer some protection against HPV. Condoms can't completely prevent infections because hard-to-see warts can be outside the area covered by a condom, and the virus can infect people even when a partner doesn't have warts. Also, condoms can break.<br><br>

    ♦ The only way to be completely sure about preventing HPV infections and other STDs is not to have sex (abstinence). Spermicidal foams, creams, and jellies aren't proven to protect against HPV or genital warts.<br><br>

    ♦ If you have questions about the vaccine or are worried about STDs, talk to your doctor

<h1>✫ Cancer Basics</h1>
<P>
    ♦ Most people don't usually associate cancer with teens because it's more common in adults. You probably know someone who has had it, such as an older relative or someone in a friend's family.

    ♦ But teens can get some types of cancer, too. Read on to learn about cancer and how it's treated.

<h1>✫ What Is Cancer?</h1>
<img src="Images/cancer.webp" width="400px" alt="" srcset="">
<P>
    ♦ The word cancer actually refers to many diseases, not one. In fact, there are more than 100 types of diseases known collectively as cancer. What they all have in common is the overgrowth of cells, tiny units that make up all living things. Cancer (also known as malignancy, pronounced: muh-LIG-nun-see) occurs when cells begin to grow and multiply in an uncontrolled way.<br><br>

    ♦ Normal body cells grow and divide over a period of time until they eventually die. But cancer cells continue to grow and divide and grow and divide. Eventually, they gather to form tumors. Tumors are lumps that can interfere with the body's normal processes. Sometimes cells from a tumor break away and travel to a different tissue or organ. This is called metastasis (pronounced: muh-TASS-tuh-siss).<br><br>

    ♦ As scary as all this sounds, most cancers can be treated and controlled and many people with cancer get better and lead normal lives.

<h1>✫ How Do People Get Cancer?</h1>
<img src="Images/cancer1.webp"  width="400px" srcset="">
<P>
    ♦ No one really knows why cancer grows in certain people. Scientists and researchers are working to discover why some people get cancer and others do not. This will help them to learn whether cancer can be prevented.<br><br>

    ♦ Doctors do have some ideas about why people may get cancer, though. The main reasons are genetics and certain environmental or behavioral triggers.<br><br>

    ♦ The tendency to develop some types of cancer is believed to be inherited — that is, the genes you were born with might carry a predisposition for cancer. For example, if a close relative has had cancer of the breast or the colon, you may be more likely to inherit the tendency to develop those cancers, even though you may never actually get them.<br><br>

    ♦ Some behavioral and environmental triggers can cause changes in the body's cells that push them into a cancerous state. For example, cigarettes are known to increase the risk of lung cancer. Too much exposure to the sun can increase the risk of skin cancer. These types of triggers act on the body slowly over time, so the cancers that may result from them don't show up until a person is an adult. That's one reason why teens don't get the same types of cancers as adults do.<br><br>

    ♦ Doctors do know for sure that cancer itself is not contagious, so you don't have to worry about catching it from someone else or spreading it to another person (although people with certain infectious diseases such as AIDS or hepatitis are more vulnerable to certain cancers). Cancer is also never a person's fault. It's simply not true that a person may have done something wrong to get the disease.<br><br>
