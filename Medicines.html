    <h1>Fever:</h1>

      <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-pills">paracitamol</i></h2> 
      The most well known drug for fever is "Paracetamol" found in every home.
      Overdose of Paracetamol may lead to hepatotoxicity and renal damage which
      can be fatal. Paracetamol is a medicine used for mild to moderate pain. It
      can be bought over the counter in pharmacies, supermarkets and other
      shops.<br><br>
      ♦ fever (high temperature)<br>
      ♦ stronger pain — used with other pain relievers such as codeine
      <br /><br>                                                                                                            
      Paracetamol has been in use for more than 70 years. The way it works to
      reduce pain and fever is not fully understood. Paracetamol begins to ease
      pain and lower a high temperature about 30 minutes after a dose is taken.
      Its effects usually last for about 4 to 6 hours.
      <br />
      Modified release paracetamol has a higher dose of paracetamol than
      standard paracetamol tablets. This can also be called:
      <br><br>
      ♦ controlled release paracetamol <br>
      ♦ extended-release paracetamol<br>
      ♦  slow-release paracetamol<br>
      ♦ sustained release paracetamol<br>

      <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-pills">Aspirin</i></h2>
      Most familiar drugs used for combating pain includes Aspirin(Disprin),
      Ibuprofen and Diclofenac. The common problems associated with these drugs
      <br />
      <br />
      Aspirin is used to reduce fever and relieve mild to moderate pain from
      conditions such as muscle aches, toothaches, common cold, and headaches.
      It may also be used to reduce pain and swelling in conditions such as
      arthritis. Aspirin is known as a salicylate and a nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It works by blocking a certain natural
      substance in your body to reduce pain and swelling. Consult your doctor
      before treating a child younger than 12 years.Your doctor may direct you
      to take a low dose of aspirin to prevent blood clots. This effect reduces
      the risk of stroke and heart attack. If you have recently had surgery on
      clogged arteries (such as bypass surgery, carotid endarterectomy, coronary
      stent), your doctor may direct you to use aspirin in low doses as a "blood
      thinner" to prevent blood clots
      <br />
      <br />
      If your condition lasts or gets worse (such as new or unusual symptoms,
      redness/swelling of the painful area, pain/fever that does not go away or
      gets worse) or if you think you may have a serious medical problem, tell
      your doctor promptly.

      <h2> <i class="fa-solid fa-pills">Acidon</i></h2>
      Antacids are widely used for 'Self medication' for the treatment of
      acidity but certain antacids are not safe to use. Antacids containing
      Sodium bicarbonate or Magnessium trisillicate can impose serious clinical
      implications. Sodium bicarbonate and Magnessium trisillicate are absorbed
      directly into the blood and may lead to systemic alkalosis and renal
      impairment. Antacids containing Aluminium hydroxide alone may lead to
      constipation.<br /><br />
      Take this product by mouth as directed. For the chewable form, chew the
      medication well before swallowing. For the liquid form, shake the bottle
      well before each dose. Follow all directions on the product package. Do
      not take more than the maximum recommended dose stated on the product
      package. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
      <br /><br />
      Tell your doctor if your condition lasts or gets worse. Do not take the
      maximum dose of the medication for more than 2 weeks unless directed by
      your doctor. If you think you may have a serious medical problem, get
      medical help right away.

    <h1>painkiller:</h1>

    <p>
      <h2> <i class="fa-solid fa-pills">Anti-inflammatory painkillers</i></h2>
      These are painkillers which also reduce inflammation. Most need a
      prescription but you can buy ibuprofen from pharmacies and supermarkets.
      <br />
      <br />
      This is helpful for muscular aches and sprains and can be used to relieve
      period pain. Like paracetamol, ibuprofen also reduces distress during a
      fever. Ibuprofen also comes in tablet, soluble tablet, melt-in-the-mouth
      and liquid forms. There are many brands of ibuprofen. The dose advised
      varies with age. Anti-inflammatory painkillers should not be used by
      certain people - for example, if you have, or have had, a stomach or
      duodenal ulcer. These painkillers should be taken with food if possible,
      because they can cause irritation if taken on an empty stomach.
      <br /><br />
      If you develop stomach pain or heartburn after taking ibuprofen tablets,
      you should stop them. They may interact with some prescribed medication,
      so check with your pharmacist if you are not sure whether you should take
      them. Ibuprofen and some other anti-inflammatory painkillers are also
      available as a gel or foam. These can be rubbed directly into the painful
      area. They are used for painful joints if you have rheumatoid arthritis or
      wear and tear arthritis (osteoarthritis). They can also be used for
      sprains and muscle injuries.

    <p><h2> <i class="fa-solid fa-pills">Indigestion treatment</i></h2>
       <b> When to take?</b><br>
        Heartburn and acid reflux are the same thing – when the acid from your stomach comes up to your throat. You’ll have a burning feeling when this happens. This can be a symptom of indigestion.
        <br><br>
        You can take indigestion remedies if you suffer from heartburn– a painful burning feeling in the chest, often after eating or you are feeling full and bloated, feeling sick, belching and passing wind or bringing up food or bitter tasting fluids.
        <br><br>
        There are lots of over the counter indigestion remedies available, popular ones are Gaviscon, Rennie, Zantac
        <br><br>
       <b> How many to take?</b><br><br>
       ♦  Dose is varied, so follow the instructions on the package of medication.
        <br>
        ♦ It’s best to take indigestion treatment with food or soon after eating because this is when you’re most likely to get indigestion or heartburn.
