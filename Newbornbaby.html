    <h1>✫ A Guide for First-Time Parents</h1>
    <p>
      ♦ Life has changed now that your baby is here, and you might have lots of
      questions about what to do. These tips can help first-time parents feel
      confident about caring for a newborn in no time.
    </p>

    <h2>✫ How Do I Get Help After My Baby Comes Home?</h2>
    <p>
      ♦ An important part of caring for a newborn is to also take care of
      yourself. Consider getting help during this time, which can feel hectic
      and a bit overwhelming. <br /><br />
      ♦ Relatives and friends might want to help. Even if you disagree on some
      things, their own experiences might be helpful.
      <br /><br />
      ♦To keep your baby healthy, anyone handling your little one should be up
      to date on their vaccines and help only if they feel well. But if you
      don't feel up to having guests or have other concerns, don't feel guilty
      about limiting visitors.
    </p>
    <h2>✫ How Do I Handle My Baby?</h2>
    <p>
      ♦ if you haven't spent a lot of time around newborns, they may seem very
      fragile. Here are a few basics to remember:
    </p>

    <p>
      <b><a href="washyourhandnewbornbaby.html"> ♦ Wash your hands</a></b> (or
      use a hand sanitizer) before handling your baby. Newborns don't have a
      strong immune system yet, so they're at risk for infections. Make sure
      that everyone who handles your baby has clean hands
    </p>
    <p>
      ♦ Support your baby's head and neck. Cradle the head when carrying your
      baby. And support the head when carrying the baby upright or when you lay
      your baby down.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b
        ><a href="nevershackbabynewbornbaby.html">♦ Never shake your baby</a></b
      >
      whether in play or in frustration. Shaking can cause bleeding in the brain
      and sometimes death. If you need to wake your baby, don't do it by
      shaking. Instead, tickle your baby's feet or blow gently on a cheek<br /><br />
      ♦ Always fasten your baby securely when using a carrier, stroller, or car
      seat. Limit any activity that could be too rough or bouncy.<br /><br />
      ♦ Avoid rough play with newborns, such as jiggling them on the knee or
      throwing them in the air.
    </p>
    <h1>✫ How Can I Bond With My Baby?</h1>
    <p>
      <b><a href="bondingnewbornbaby.html">♦ Bonding</a> </b>happens during the first hours and days
      after birth when parents make a deep connection with their child. Physical
      closeness can help form an emotional link and help your baby develop in
      other ways. Another way to think of bonding is "falling in love" with your
      baby. Kids thrive from having a parent or other adult in their life who
      loves them unconditionally.<br /><br />
      ♦ Begin bonding by cradling and gently stroking your baby in different
      patterns. Another good technique is skin-to-skin contact (also called
      kangaroo care), where you hold your newborn against your own chest. This
      helps calm and soothe babies and regulate their heartbeat. It’s a good
      practice for moms or dads to do <br /><br />
      <b>✫ Here’s how to do skin-to-skin contact with your baby:</b><br /><br />
      ♦Avoid using scented perfumes or lotions and stay away from cigarette
      smoke beforehand.<br /><br />
      ♦Find a comfortable seat in a dimly-lit room. Wear a shirt that opens in
      the front. Lay your baby in just a diaper on your bare chest.<br /><br />
      ♦ Sit quietly, talk softly, hum, sing, or read aloud. Your baby may sleep
      during this time.

    <h1>✫ How Can Soothe My Baby?</h1>
    <p>
      ✫ Helping babies relax can help them feel happier and more comfortable.
      Here are some tips on soothing your baby.<br /><br />
      <b>♦ Massage:</b> Infant massage may help babies, especially those who
      were born early or have medical problems. Some types of massage may
      enhance bonding and help babies grow and develop. Many books and videos
      cover infant massage — ask your doctor for recommendations. Be careful,
      though — babies aren’t as strong as adults, so massage your baby gently.<br><br>

      <b>♦ Sounds</b>: Babies usually love vocal sounds, such as talking,
      babbling, singing, and cooing. Your baby will probably enjoy listening to
      soft music. Baby rattles and musical mobiles are other good ways to
      stimulate your <b><a href="#">infant's hearing.</a></b> If your little one is fussy, try singing,
      reciting poetry and nursery rhymes, or reading aloud as you sway or rock
      your baby gently in a chair.<br>
      Some babies can be unusually sensitive to
      touch, light, or sound. They might startle and cry easily, sleep less than
      expected, or turn their faces away when someone speaks or sings to them.
      If that's the case with your baby, keep noise and light levels low to
      medium.
