    <h1>✫ A Guide for First-Time Parents</h1>
    <p>
      ♦ Life has changed now that your baby is here, and you might have lots of
      questions about what to do. These tips can help first-time parents feel
      confident about caring for a newborn in no time.

      <h2>✫ How Do I Get Help After My Baby Comes Home?</h2>
      <p> ♦ An important part of caring for a newborn is to also take care of
        yourself. Consider getting help during this time, which can feel hectic
        and a bit overwhelming. <br /><br />
        ♦ Relatives and friends might want to help. Even if you disagree on some
        things, their own experiences might be helpful.
        <br /><br />
        ♦ To keep your baby healthy, anyone handling your little one should be up
        to date on their vaccines and help only if they feel well. But if you
        don't feel up to having guests or have other concerns, don't feel guilty
        about limiting visitors..</p>

      <h2>✫ How Do I Handle My Baby?</h2>
      <p>
        ♦ if you haven't spent a lot of time around newborns, they may seem very
        fragile. Here are a few basics to remember:
    <br>  <br>
        <b><a href="washyourhandnewbornbaby.html"> ♦ Wash your hands</a></b> (or
        use a hand sanitizer) before handling your baby. Newborns don't have a
        strong immune system yet, so they're at risk for infections. Make sure
        that everyone who handles your baby has clean hands
      <br><br>
        ♦ Support your baby's head and neck. Cradle the head when carrying your
        baby. And support the head when carrying the baby upright or when you lay
        your baby down.
      
        <b
          ><a href="nevershackbabynewbornbaby.html">♦ Never shake your baby</a></b>
        whether in play or in frustration. Shaking can cause bleeding in the brain
        and sometimes death. If you need to wake your baby, don't do it by
        shaking. Instead, tickle your baby's feet or blow gently on a cheek<br /><br />
        ♦ Always fasten your baby securely when using a carrier, stroller, or car
        seat. Limit any activity that could be too rough or bouncy.<br /><br />
        ♦ Avoid rough play with newborns, such as jiggling them on the knee or
        throwing them in the air..</p>

      <h2>✫ How Can I Bond With My Baby?</h2>
      <p><b><a href="bondingnewbornbaby.html">♦ Bonding</a> </b>happens during the first hours and days
        after birth when parents make a deep connection with their child. Physical
        closeness can help form an emotional link and help your baby develop in
        other ways. Another way to think of bonding is "falling in love" with your
        baby. Kids thrive from having a parent or other adult in their life who
        loves them unconditionally.<br /><br />
        ♦ Begin bonding by cradling and gently stroking your baby in different
        patterns. Another good technique is skin-to-skin contact (also called
        kangaroo care), where you hold your newborn against your own chest. This
        helps calm and soothe babies and regulate their heartbeat. It’s a good
        practice for moms or dads to do <br /><br />
        <b>✫ Here’s how to do skin-to-skin contact with your baby:</b><br /><br />
        ♦ Avoid using scented perfumes or lotions and stay away from cigarette
        smoke beforehand.<br /><br />
        ♦ Find a comfortable seat in a dimly-lit room. Wear a shirt that opens in
        the front. Lay your baby in just a diaper on your bare chest.<br /><br />
        ♦ Sit quietly, talk softly, hum, sing, or read aloud. Your baby may sleep
        during this time.</p>

        <h2>✫ How Can Soothe My Baby?</h2>
        <p> ✫ Helping babies relax can help them feel happier and more comfortable.
          Here are some tips on soothing your baby.<br /><br />
          <b>♦ Massage:</b> Infant massage may help babies, especially those who
          were born early or have medical problems. Some types of massage may
          enhance bonding and help babies grow and develop. Many books and videos
          cover infant massage — ask your doctor for recommendations. Be careful,
          though — babies aren’t as strong as adults, so massage your baby gently.<br><br>
    
          <b>♦ Sounds</b>: Babies usually love vocal sounds, such as talking,
          babbling, singing, and cooing. Your baby will probably enjoy listening to
          soft music. Baby rattles and musical mobiles are other good ways to
          stimulate your <b>infant's hearing.</b> If your little one is fussy, try singing,
          reciting poetry and nursery rhymes, or reading aloud as you sway or rock
          your baby gently in a chair.<br>
          Some babies can be unusually sensitive to
          touch, light, or sound. They might startle and cry easily, sleep less than
          expected, or turn their faces away when someone speaks or sings to them.
          If that's the case with your baby, keep noise and light levels low to
          medium.</p>

    <div class="city">
      <h2>✫ Talk to your newborn </h2>
      <p>   ♦ Infants enjoy sound. Talk to, read, and sing to your newborn.[9] You can also use baby rattles and musical mobiles with a newborn. If the newborn seems a little fussy, you may sing, read a nursery rhyme, or talk while you hold and rock the baby.[10]
       <br>
        ♦ If the newborn turns away, cries, or seems startled by talking or singing, your baby may be sensitive to noise. Lower the volume or use a softer tone to see if this helps./p>
        <br>
        ♦ Only the head and neck should be visible once you are finished.
       <br>
        ♦ Swaddling is only recommended for babies under two months old.
        <br>
        ♦ Do not fold the blanket too tight. Babies should have room to move their feet, hips, and knees. Folding the baby too tight can cause breathing problems and hip development issues.
        <br>
        ♦ If you are swaddling to help your baby fall asleep, only place your baby on his back.

      <div class="city">
        <h2>✫ Know normal sleeping habits.</h2>
        <p>  
          ♦ Newborns typically sleep 16–18 hours a day. They usually wake up every two to three hours to eat.[23] The length of time your baby sleeps each time will vary. Some babies will start to sleep five to six hours a night around two months of age.[24]
          <br>
          ♦ Learn what is normal for your baby.
         <br>
         ♦ Newborns do not know the difference between night and day so be prepared to run on very little sleep.
          <br>
          ♦ A newborn baby should only sleep on his back. Do not place him on his side or stomach to sleep. Stomach sleeping can lead to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Stomach sleeping can block the baby's airway and cause the baby to get too hot.
