        <p><b>   Chest discomfort.</b>
            ♦Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center of the chest that lasts more than a few minutes – or it may go away and then return. It can feel like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness or pain.<br><br>
           <b> Discomfort in other areas of the upper body. </b> 
           ♦ Symptoms can include pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw or stomach.<br><br>
           <b> Shortness of breath.</b>
           ♦ This can occur with or without chest discomfort.
            Other signs. Other possible signs include breaking out in a cold sweat, nausea or lightheadedness.</p>

            ♦ A kidney infection (pyelonephritis) is a painful and unpleasant illness caused by bacteria travelling from your bladder into one or both of your kidneys.<br><br>

            ♦ It’s more serious than cystitis, a common infection of the bladder that makes urinating painful.<br><br>

            ♦ If treated promptly, a kidney infection doesn’t cause serious harm, but will make you feel very unwell. If a kidney infection isn’t treated, it can get worse and cause permanent kidney damage.<br><br>

            ♦  Symptoms of a kidney infection often come on within a few hours. You can feel feverish, shivery, sick and have a pain in your back or side.<br><br>
            ♦  A kidney infection usually happens when bacteria – often a type called E. coli – gets into the urethra (the tube which carries urine out of the body) and travels up through the bladder and into the kidneys.<br>

           <b> Healthcare professionals diagnose sepsis using physical findings such as:</b><br><br>
           ♦ Fever<br><br>
           ♦ Low blood pressure<br><br>
           ♦ Increased heart rate<br><br>
           ♦ Difficulty breathing<br><br>
           ♦ Healthcare professionals also perform tests that check for signs of infection or organ damage. Some of these tests are used to identify the germ that caused the infection that led to sepsis. This testing might include blood cultures looking for bacterial infections, or tests for viral infections, like COVID-19 or influenza.<br>

            ♦ Fainting, also called syncope (pronounced SIN-ko-pee), is a sudden, brief loss of consciousness and posture caused by decreased blood flow to the brain.<br><br>
            ♦  Many different conditions can cause fainting. These include heart problems such as irregular heartbeats,  low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), anemia (a deficiency in healthy oxygen-carrying cells), and problems with how the nervous system regulates blood pressure. Some types of fainting seem to run in families.<br><br>
            ♦ While fainting may happen because of a particular medical condition, sometimes it may occur in an otherwise healthy person. Fainting is a particular problem for the elderly, who may suffer serious injuries from falls when they faint. Most episodes are very brief. In most cases, the individual who has fainted regains complete consciousness within just a few minutes.<br>
