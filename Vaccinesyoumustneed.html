    <h1>✫ Vaccine Basics</h1>
    <P>
        <b>✫ Why Are Vaccines Important?</b> <br><br>
        ♦ Measles, mumps, and whooping cough may seem like quaint old illnesses confined to 19th century novels. But more and more teens are being exposed to them, especially in schools and on college campuses where large numbers of people are together in close quarters.<br><br>

        ♦ Diseases like measles, which were on their way out in the United States, are making a comeback as they are brought in from other countries by travelers. These diseases wouldn't spread as quickly — or be as serious — if people were immunized against them. But many teens aren't.<br><br>

        ♦ It's not your fault if you don't have all the immunizations (vaccinations) you need. Shots that doctors recommend today may not have been required when you were younger. So you may not have had them.<br><br>

        ♦ Some vaccines (like the <b><a href="HVPVaccine.html">HPV Vaccine/ Cancer</a></b>) are given as a series of shots, not just one single dose. Some people may have missed getting all the required shots. Not getting a full course of a vaccine leaves a person unprotected and still at risk for getting a disease. Other vaccinations require a booster shot every few years to ensure that the level of immunity remains high.

     <h1>✫ The Definition of Cancer</h1>
     <img src="Images/canc2.jpg" width="400px" alt="" srcset="">
     <P>
        ♦ Cancer is a disease in which some of the body’s cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. <br><br>

        ♦ Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells. Normally, human cells grow and multiply (through a process called cell division) to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow old or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their place.<br><br>

        ♦ Sometimes this orderly process breaks down, and abnormal or damaged cells grow and multiply when they shouldn’t. These cells may form tumors, which are lumps of tissue. Tumors can be cancerous or not cancerous (benign). <br><br>

        ♦ Cancerous tumors spread into, or invade, nearby tissues and can travel to distant places in the body to form new tumors (a process called metastasis). Cancerous tumors may also be called malignant tumors. Many cancers form solid tumors, but cancers of the blood, such as leukemias, generally do not.<br><br>

        ♦ Benign tumors do not spread into, or invade, nearby tissues. When removed, benign tumors usually don’t grow back, whereas cancerous tumors sometimes do. Benign tumors can sometimes be quite large, however. Some can cause serious symptoms or be life threatening, such as benign tumors in the brain.<br><br>

     <h1>✫ How Does Cancer Develop?</h1>
     <img src="Images/cancer2.jpg"  width="400px" srcset="">
     <P>
        ♦ Cancer is a genetic disease—that is, it is caused by changes to genes that control the way our cells function, especially how they grow and divide.<br><br> 

        ♦ <b>Genetic changes that cause cancer can happen because:</b><br><br>

        ♦ of errors that occur as cells divide. <br><br>
        ♦ of damage to DNA caused by harmful substances in the environment, such as the chemicals in tobacco smoke and ultraviolet rays from the sun. (Our Cancer Causes and Prevention section has more information.) <br><br>
        ♦ they were inherited from our parents. <br><br>
        ♦ The body normally eliminates cells with damaged DNA before they turn cancerous. But the body’s ability to do so goes down as we age. This is part of the reason why there is a higher risk of cancer later in life.<br><br>

        ♦ Each person’s cancer has a unique combination of genetic changes. As the cancer continues to grow, additional changes will occur. Even within the same tumor, different cells may have different genetic changes.

     <h1>✫ When Cancer Spreads</h1>
     <img src="Images/cancer4.jpg" width="400px" alt="" srcset="">
     <P>
        ♦ A cancer that has spread from the place where it first formed to another place in the body is called metastatic cancer. The process by which cancer cells spread to other parts of the body is called metastasis. <br><br>

        ♦ Metastatic cancer has the same name and the same type of cancer cells as the original, or primary, cancer. For example, breast cancer that forms a metastatic tumor in the lung is metastatic breast cancer, not lung cancer. <br><br>

        ♦ Vunder a microscope, metastatic cancer cells generally look the same as cells of the original cancer. Moreover, metastatic cancer cells and cells of the original cancer usually have some molecular features in common, such as the presence of specific chromosome changes. <br><br>

        ♦ In some cases, treatment may help prolong the lives of people with metastatic cancer. In other cases, the primary goal of treatment for metastatic cancer is to control the growth of the cancer or to relieve symptoms it is causing. Metastatic tumors can cause severe damage to how the body functions, and most people who die of cancer die of metastatic disease.
