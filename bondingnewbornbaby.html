      <b>✫What Is Bonding?</b><br /><br />
      ♦ Bonding is the intense attachment that develops between parents and
      their baby. It makes parents want to shower their baby with love and
      affection and to protect and care for their little one. Bonding gets
      parents up in the middle of the night to feed their hungry baby and makes
      them attentive to the baby's wide range of cries.<br /><br/>
      ♦ Scientists are still learning a lot about bonding. They know that the
      strong ties between parents and their child provide the baby's first model
      for intimate relationships and foster a sense of security and positive
      self-esteem. And parents' responsiveness to an infant's signals can affect
      the child's social and cognitive development.

    <h1>✫ Why Is Bonding Important?</h1>
    <p>
        ♦ Bonding is essential for a baby. Studies of newborn monkeys who were given
      mannequin mothers at birth showed that, even when the mannequins were made
      of soft material and provided formula to the baby monkeys, the babies were
      better socialized when they had live mothers to interact with. The baby
      monkeys with mannequin mothers also were more likely to suffer from
      despair. Scientists suspect that lack of bonding in human babies can cause
      similar problems.<br /><br/>
       ♦ Most infants are ready to bond right away. Parents, on
      the other hand, may mixed feelings. Some feel an intense attachment within
      the first minutes or days after their baby's birth. For others, it may
      take a bit longer.<br /><br/>
      ♦ But bonding is a process, not something that takes
      place within minutes or that can only happen within a certain time period
      after birth. For many parents, bonding builds out of everyday caregiving.
      You may not even know it's happening until you see your baby's first smile
      and suddenly realize that you're filled with love and joy.

    <h1>✫ How Do Babies Bond?</h1>
    <P><b>When you're a new parent, it can take a while to understand your newborn and all the ways you can interact:</b><br><br>
        ♦ Touch becomes an early language as babies respond to skin-to-skin contact. It's soothing for both you and your baby while promoting your baby's healthy growth and development.<br><br>
        ♦ Eye-to-eye contact provides meaningful communication at close range.<br><br>
        ♦ Babies can follow moving objects with their eyes.<br><br>
        ♦ Your baby tries — early on — to imitate your facial expressions and gestures.<br><br>
        ♦ Babies prefer human voices and enjoy vocalizing in their first efforts at communication. Babies often enjoy just listening to your conversations, as well as your descriptions of their activities and environments.<br><br>

    <h1>✫ What Can Help Make an Attachment?</h1>
  <P>
    ♦ Bonding with your baby is probably one of the most pleasurable aspects of infant care. You can begin by cradling and gently rocking or stroking your baby. If you and your partner both hold and touch your infant often, your little one will soon come to know the difference between your touches. Both parents can have "skin-to-skin" contact with their newborn by holding the baby against their own skin when feeding or cradling.<br><br>

    ♦ Babies, especially premature babies and those with medical problems, may respond to infant massage. Because babies aren't as strong as adults, massage your baby very gently. Before trying infant massage, learn about proper techniques by checking out the many books, videos, and websites on the subject. You can also contact your local hospital to find out if there are classes in infant massage in your area.<br><br>

    ♦ Breastfeeding and bottle-feeding are both natural times for bonding. Infants respond to the smell and touch of their mothers, as well as the responsiveness of the parents to their needs. In an uncomplicated birth, caregivers can take advantage of the infant's alert period right after birth by feeding and holding the baby. This isn't always possible, though, and immediate contact isn't necessary for the future bonding of babies and their parents.<br><br>

    ♦ Adoptive parents may be concerned about bonding with their baby. It might happen sooner for some than others, but adopted babies and their parents can bond just as well as biological parents and their children.
