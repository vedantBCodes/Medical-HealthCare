    <h1>✫ ISSUE BRIEF: CARE COORDINATION</h1>
    <P>  ♦There has been significant emphasis in the last several years on care coordination’s role in
        supporting older adults and in reaching the key aims of health care reform, namely improved
        patient outcomes, enhanced care experience, reduced costs, reduced provider burnout, and equity
        in outcomes. <br><br>
        ♦ This issue brief provides updates to the 2013 care coordination issue brief developed by Eldercare
        Workforce Alliance (EWA) and the National Coalition on Care Coordination (N3C).i It includes a
        synthesis of diverse strategies in use and a vision for how services could be improved.</P>

        <h1>✫ Care coordination: what, why, who, where, and how?</h1>
        <b> ✫ What and why?</b>
        <P>
            ♦  Care coordination is a methodical approach to care that facilitates better communication between
and among individuals, family caregivers, and service providers. Care coordination is defined by
the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) as the “deliberate organization of patient
care activities between two or more participants (including the patient) involved in a patient’s care
to facilitate the appropriate delivery of health care services.”ii <br> <br>
♦  Well-designed coordination leads to improved outcomes, efficient care, and optimizes support
systems for older adults and family caregivers. Care coordination models have designated protocol
and guidelines that allow for consistency in approach, focus and scope of intervention, and
workflow

        <h1>✫ AHRQ describes the following activities typically included in care coordination: </h1><br><br>
<P>
    ♦ Establishment of accountability or negotiation of responsibility<br><br>
• Communication<br><br>
• Facilitation of transitions between care settings and practitioners<br><br>
• Assessment of needs and goals<br><br>
• Creation of a proactive plan of care<br><br>
• Monitoring, follow-up, and responsiveness to change<br><br>
• Support of self-management goals<br><br>
• Linkage with community resources<br><br>
• Alignment resources with individual and population needs<br><br>
• Medication managementi<br><br>
</P>
<h3>✫ Who?</h3>
<p>♦ Individuals and family caregivers play integral roles in care provision, and their perspectives are
    central to the success of care coordination initiatives. <br><br>

    ♦ Older adults and families often work closely with health care teams composed of a range of
    disciplines —including, but not limited to, community health workers, direct care workers, nurses,
    pharmacists, physicians, and social workers—who lead and participate in care coordination
    initiatives. Care teams can live within a variety of settings, including community-based
    organizations [CBOs] that are part of the aging network.iv CBOs can play a particularly key role in
    care coordination efforts, such as by helping to bridge clinical health care and social services, and
    by supporting self-care for chronic conditions. Local grassroots groups (such as volunteer
    networks, cultural communities, and faith-based organizations) can also support care coordination
    efforts.<br>

</p>
<h3>✫ Where?</h3>
<P>♦ Care coordination should be happening wherever and whenever care is provided. Care
    coordination efforts may be staffed within various settings: office-based primary care teams, house
    call programs, specialty care teams (such as oncology), hospitals (often staffed by discharge
    planners or transitional care coordinators), skilled nursing facilities, hospice and palliative care
    programs, aging network organizations, and housing programs. Insurance plans may have their
    own care coordinators as well, and approaches that integrate multiple types of care under one team
    (such as the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly and Accountable Care Organizations) may
    have care coordinators that span service settings.</P>
    <h3>✫ How?</h3>
    <P>♦Care coordination activities can be intrinsic to a program—that is, part of the infrastructure—or
        external to a program—that is, a separate initiative built on top of other services. Although care
        coordination may be intrinsic to integrated teams, such teams still need to decide how they will
        work together on the tasks described above, who will take the lead on which tasks (and with which
        individuals served), and decision-making processes.<br><br>
        ♦Two priorities are necessary to promote effective, efficient care coordination. First, the workforce
        must be prepared with appropriate knowledge, skills, and training. Second, care design must be
        streamlined so that coordination of care becomes intrinsic to service delivery</P>
