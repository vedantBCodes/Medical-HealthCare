        <h2>✫ Which Children Are at Risk for Abusive Head Trauma?</h2>
        <p>♦ Most cases of abusive head trauma (also called shaken baby syndrome) happen to babies and toddlers younger than 2 years old. Rarely, it can happen in children up to 5 years old. It can happen to boys or girls in any family<br><br>
           ♦ At special risk for abuse are children who have a lot of special needs or health problems that make them cry a lot, like colic and GER

          <h1>✫ Shaking a baby is so harmful because:</h1><br><br>
          ♦ Infants have poor neck strength and their heads are large compared with the size of their bodies. This lets the head move around a lot when shaken.<br><br>
            ♦ When the head moves around, the baby or child's brain moves back and forth inside the skull. This can tear blood vessels and nerves inside or around the brain, causing bleeding and nerve damage.<br><br>
            ♦ The brain may hit against the inside of the skull, causing brain bruising and bleeding on the outside of the brain.<br><br>
            ♦ Brain swelling builds pressure in the skull. This pressure makes it hard for blood, carrying oxygen and nutrients, to reach the brain, further harming it.</P>
