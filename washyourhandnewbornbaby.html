    <h1>✫ Hand Washing: Why It's So Important</h1>
    <p>♦ It's a message worth repeating — hand washing is by far the best way to keep kids from getting sick and prevent the spread of germs.</p>
<h2>✫ What's the Best Way to Wash Hands?</h2>
<p>Here's how to scrub those <b>germs</b> away. Teach this to your kids — or better yet, wash your hands together often so they learn how important this good habit is:</p>
<P>
   <b>1. Wet your hands</b>  with clean, running water (warm or cold). Make sure the water isn't too hot for little hands.<br><br>
<b>2. Use soap </b>and lather up for about 20 seconds. Antibacterial soap isn't a must — any soap will do.<br><br>
<b>3.</b>Make sure you <b>get in between your fingers</b>, on the backs of hands, and under the nails where germs like to hang out. And don't forget the wrists!<br><br>
<b>4. Rinse and dry </b>well with a clean towel
</P>
<h2>✫ When Should We Wash Our Hands?</h2>
<p>♦ To stop the spread of germs in your family, make regular hand washing a rule for everyone. It's especially important:<br>
♦ before eating and cooking<br><br>
♦ after using the bathroom<br><br>
♦ after cleaning around the house<br><br>
♦ after touching animals, including family pets<br><br>
♦ before and after visiting or taking care of any sick friends or relatives<br><br>
♦ after blowing one's nose, coughing, or sneezing<br><br>
♦ after being outside (playing, gardening, walking the dog, etc.)</p>
<h2>✫ How Do Germs Spread?</h2>
<p>♦ Germs can spread many ways, including:br><br><br>
    ♦ touching dirty handsbr><br><br>
    ♦ changing dirty diapers<br><br>
    ♦ through contaminated water and food<br><br>
    ♦ through droplets in the air released during a cough or sneeze<br><br>
    ♦ on contaminated surfaces<br><br>
    ♦ through contact with a sick person's body fluids</p>
    <P>♦ When kids have contact with germs, they can become infected just by touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. And once they're infected, it's usually just a matter of time before the whole family comes down with the same illness. <br><br>
        ♦ So don't underestimate the power of hand washing! The time you spend at the sink could save you trips to the doctor's office.
